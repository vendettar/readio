# Accessibility (A11y) Standards

Readio must be usable by everyone.
As a "Vibe Coding" project, we rely on **Headless UI** libraries (Radix/Shadcn) to handle the heavy lifting, but we must use them correctly.

## 1. The "No Mouse" Rule

**Rule**: Every feature MUST be usable with **Keyboard Only**.
- **Tab**: Move focus between interactive elements.
- **Enter/Space**: Activate buttons/links.
- **Esc**: Close modals/menus.

**Self-Check**: Before finishing a task, put your mouse away and try to use the feature.

## 2. Interactive Elements

### Buttons vs Divs
- ❌ **Wrong**: `<div onClick={...}>` (Invisible to keyboard/screen readers)
- ✅ **Right**: `<Button>` or `<div role="button" tabIndex={0} onKeyDown={...}>`
- **Vibe Rule**: Just use `shadcn/ui` components (`Button`, `Card` as button). They handle this for you.

### Icon Buttons
Every icon-only button MUST have a label.

```tsx
// ❌ Bad
<Button><PlayIcon /></Button>

// ✅ Good (Visually hidden label)
<Button size="icon" aria-label="Play Episode">
  <PlayIcon />
</Button>
```

## 3. Focus Management

- **Focus Ring**: Never remove the default focus ring (`outline-none`) unless you replace it with a custom `ring-*` utility. Users must know where they are.
- **Modals**: When opening a Dialog, focus must move inside. When closing, focus must return to the trigger. (Radix handles this, don't break it).

## 4. Semantic HTML

Don't just use `<div>` for everything.
- Lists: `<ul>` / `<ol>`
- Headings: `<h1>` -> `<h2>` -> `<h3>` (Hierarchy matters)
- Articles: `<article>` for podcast cards.

## 5. Color Contrast

- Ensure text is readable against backgrounds.
- Use Tailwind's `text-muted-foreground` carefully—ensure it's not too faint.

## 6. RTL Support & Logical Properties

Readio supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages.
- **Logical Properties**: Always use logical properties instead of physical ones.
  - ❌ `ml-`, `mr-` -> ✅ `ms-`, `me-` (Margin Start/End)
  - ❌ `pl-`, `pr-` -> ✅ `ps-`, `pe-` (Padding Start/End)
  - ❌ `left-`, `right-` -> ✅ `start-`, `end-`
  - ❌ `text-left`, `text-right` -> ✅ `text-start`, `text-end`
- **Icon Flipping**: Directional icons (arrows, chevrons, skips) should be flipped in RTL.
  - Use `className="rtl:rotate-180"`.
- **Testing**: Add `dir="rtl"` to the `html` tag to verify layouts.

## Planned (Pending Execution)

- **Accessibility Audit**: Icon labels, focus order, and Lighthouse A11y target > 90 (Instruction 048).
- **Lighthouse CI Budget**: CI gate for A11y/Performance/Best Practices (Instruction 077).
