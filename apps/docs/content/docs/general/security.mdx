# Security & Privacy Standards

Readio is committed to user data sovereignty and absolute security.

---

## 1. HTML Sanitization (Anti-XSS)

**Rule**: NEVER use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` directly with raw data from RSS feeds or files.
- **Strictly Required**: All HTML content must be sanitized before rendering.
- **Tool**: Use `DOMPurify` (via the wrapper `src/lib/htmlUtils.ts`).
- **Policy**: Only safe tags (formatting, links) are allowed. Scripts, frames, and tracking pixels are stripped.

## 2. Privacy & Data Sovereignty

### A. Proxy Privacy (Critical)
**Problem**: Third-party CORS proxies (like AllOrigins) see every URL you request.
**Rules**: 
- **User Choice**: Provide a toggle in Settings to disable public proxies.
- **Disclosure**: Warn users in the UI when a request is routed through a public proxy.
- **Sensitive Data**: Never pass authentication headers, API keys, or cookies through public proxies.

### B. Error Reporting Privacy
**Rule**: Do NOT collect Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
- **Forbidden**: Do not log filenames, local file paths, podcast titles, or user queries.
- **Allowed**: Generic error codes, browser version, and anonymized stack traces (paths must be stripped of local usernames).

## 3. External Links
**Rule**: Use `src/lib/openExternal.ts` for all external navigation.
- **Requirements**: Must include `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

## 4. Local File Security
**Rule**: The app must never attempt to upload the content of local media files to any server.
- **Processing**: All metadata extraction (ID3 tags) must happen client-side (via Web Workers).

## 5. Dependencies
**Rule**: No new NPM packages without an audit of their security history and license.
