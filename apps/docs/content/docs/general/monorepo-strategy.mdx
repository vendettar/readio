# Monorepo Strategy & Future Apps

Readio is designed to evolve from a single PWA into a multi-platform ecosystem.
This document outlines the roadmap for `apps/cloud` and `apps/native`.

## 1. Apps Overview

| App | Path | Type | Status | Goal |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lite** | `apps/lite` | SPA/PWA | 🟢 Live | Zero-dependency, offline-first player. |
| **Cloud** | `apps/cloud` | SaaS | ⚪ Planned | Sync, social, and AI features. |
| **Native** | `apps/native` | Mobile | ⚪ Planned | iOS/Android wrapper via Capacitor. |

---

## 2. Cloud Strategy (The Backend)

**Role**: Optional enhancement. The app must work perfectly without it.

### Planned Features (P2/P3)
- **Data Sync**: Sync subscriptions and progress across devices.
- **AI Services**: Server-side Whisper (Transcription) and LLM (Summary).
- **Social**: Comments and "Podcast Clubs".

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Hono or Spring Boot.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Supabase/Neon).
- **Auth**: JWT-based (Stateless).

---

## 3. Native Strategy (The Wrapper)

**Role**: Access system APIs that PWA cannot reach.

### Planned Features (P2)
- **Background Audio**: Native iOS/Android audio session handling.
- **Notifications**: Push notifications for new episodes.
- **Widgets**: Home screen widgets.
- **CarPlay / Auto**: Simplified UI for driving.

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Capacitor (wrapping `apps/lite`).
- **Shared Code**: Logic in `packages/core`.

---

## 4. Shared Packages (`packages/`)

To support this evolution, we must move logic out of `apps/lite` into shared packages.

- **`packages/core`**: Stores, Hooks, Utils (Platform agnostic).
- **`packages/ui`**: Design System components.
- **`packages/api`**: Zod schemas and API clients.

---

## Planned (Pending Execution)

- **Architecture Map**: Mermaid diagram linking `apps/docs`, `apps/lite`, and `agent/instructions` (Instruction 059).
- **Turborepo Cache Hardening**: Explicit inputs/outputs for build caching (Instruction 066).
