# Debugging & Error Handling

This document defines the standard strategy for handling errors, logging, and debugging in Readio.

## 1. Error Handling Philosophy

We distinguish between three types of errors:

### A. Operational Errors (User-Facing)
Expected failures during normal operation (e.g., "Network Offline", "File not found").
- **Action**: Show a UI feedback (Toast or Empty State).
- **Log**: `console.warn` (optional).
- **Crash**: **NEVER**.

### B. Programmer Errors (Bugs)
Unexpected states caused by bad code (e.g., `undefined is not a function`, `zod parse failed`).
- **Action**: Caught by `ErrorBoundary`.
- **Log**: `console.error` + Report to Error Monitoring Service.
- **UI**: Show "Something went wrong" fallback component.

### C. Critical System Errors
Failures that corrupt the app state (e.g., Dexie DB corruption).
- **Action**: Attempt automated recovery (e.g., wipe cache) or prompt user for "Hard Reset".

## 2. Logging Standard (`src/lib/logger.ts`)

Do NOT use raw `console.log` in production code. Use the logger wrapper.

```tsx
import { log, warn, error } from '@/lib/logger'

// ✅ Good
log('Player', 'Audio loaded', { url })
warn('Discovery', 'Feed parsing incomplete', { feedUrl })
error('Files', 'Ingestion failed', err)

// ❌ Bad
console.log('test', data) // Remove before commit
```

**Why?** Wrappers allow us to strip logs in production or redirect them to a service (Sentry/LogRocket) later without changing feature code.

## 3. Error Boundaries

We use a tiered Error Boundary strategy:

1.  **Root Boundary** (`RootErrorBoundary.tsx`): Catches crash-level errors. Renders a full-page "Oops" screen with a "Reset App" button.
2.  **Feature Boundary** (Optional): Wrap complex widgets (e.g., `PodcastPlayer`) so that if the player crashes, the rest of the app (Library) still works.

## 4. Debugging Tools

### Zod Schema Validation
When API data looks wrong, don't guess.
- **Strategy**: Use `schema.safeParse(data)`.
- **Debug**: If `!result.success`, log `result.error.format()`.

### Zustand DevTools
- The store middleware is enabled in development.
- Use Redux DevTools extension to time-travel debug state changes.

### Diagnostic Logs [Implemented]
As PWAs run in restricted environments, remote debugging is difficult. Users can assist by exporting technical logs:
- **Location**: Settings > Diagnostic Tools.
- **Data**: Contains the last 100 entries of errors, warnings, and info logs.
- **Privacy**: All PII (user paths, file names, emails) is automatically redacted before the log is saved to the buffer.
- **Export**: Generates a `.json` file containing timestamps, levels, and (where applicable) stack traces.
- **Note**: Global `error` / `unhandledrejection` listeners are registered in `main.tsx`. This is safe for a single SPA instance. If we ever embed multiple app instances (micro‑frontend), add a single‑instance guard to avoid duplicate listeners.

### Dexie Inspector
- Use the browser's "Application -> IndexedDB" tab.
- **Tip**: If schema changes cause issues, clear the DB manually here.

## 5. Disaster Recovery (Chaos Engineering)

### A. The "Nuclear Option" (?reset-db=1)
**Problem**: If IndexedDB becomes corrupted, the app may fail to load entirely.
**Solution**: The app MUST listen for a `reset-db` query parameter in the URL during the earliest boot stage (`main.tsx`).
- **Action**: If `?reset-db=1` is present, bypass all store initialization and call `DB.clearAllData()`.
- **User Instruction**: Tell users to visit `readio.app/?reset-db=1` if the app is stuck on a white screen.

### B. Handling Quota Exceeded
**Problem**: Disk full.
**Rule**: All file ingestion actions MUST catch `QuotaExceededError`.
- **Action**: Show a specific toast: "Storage full! Please delete some files in Settings to continue."
- **Check**: Use `navigator.storage.estimate()` to warn the user before they even start a large upload.

## Planned (Pending Execution)

## 6. Case Studies & Known Issues

### MP3 Artwork: Missing EOI Marker
**Problem**: Some MP3s contain valid JPEG data in their ID3 tags but are missing the End of Image (EOI) marker (`FF D9`).
- **Symptom**: Chrome/Blink browsers truncate the bottom of the image (often 10-20%), while macOS Finder or older tools display it correctly (due to more lenient decoders).
- **Error**: `createImageBitmap` throws `InvalidStateError`.
- **Solution**: Implemented in `src/lib/files/ingest.ts`.
  1. **Binary Fix**: We scan the blob's tail. If `FF D9` is missing, we append it manually to the Uint8Array.
  2. **Normalization**: We pass the fixed blob through an offscreen Canvas. This re-encodes the image into a perfectly valid standard JPEG, ensuring it works across all devices and caches correctly in IndexedDB.
