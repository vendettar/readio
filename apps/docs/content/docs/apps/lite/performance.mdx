# Performance Guidelines

Readio is an audio application. 
**Goal**: Audio playback must NEVER stutter, and CPU usage must be minimal to save battery.

---

## 1. Battery Conservation (The "Hidden" Rule)

**Rule**: Pause non-essential work when the tab is not visible.
- **Mechanism**: Use `document.hidden` or `Page Visibility API`.
- **Optimization**:
  - Stop updating the Transcript active line highlighting if the tab is hidden.
  - Slow down UI polling/refresh intervals.
  - Resume immediately when `visibilitychange` fires.
  - Use `usePageVisibility` to throttle `GlobalAudioController` progress updates to **≤ 1/sec** when hidden.
  - Pause CSS and Framer Motion animations in `FullPlayer` while hidden (do not unmount).

## 2. Memory Management (The Revoke Rule) - **IMPLEMENTED** (Instruction 027)

**Rule**: Every `URL.createObjectURL()` MUST have a corresponding `URL.revokeObjectURL()`.

- **Audio Blobs**: Object URLs are managed **strictly inside the store** (`playerStore`). Components must NEVER call `URL.createObjectURL` for audio; they should use `loadAudio` or `loadAudioBlob` which handle revocation of previous URLs automatically before creating new ones.
- **Image Blobs**: Components and UI elements must use the `useImageObjectUrl` hook to manage artwork Blobs. This ensures URLs are revoked automatically when the component unmounts or the Blob changes.
- **Verification**: If memory usage increases after every song change, you have a leaked Object URL.

## 3. List Virtualization

**Rule**: Any list that can potentially grow > 50 items MUST be virtualized.
- **Tool**: `react-virtuoso`.
- **Scenarios**:
  - Podcast Episode Lists.
  - File Explorer (Folders/Tracks).
  - Transcript View (Every line is a virtual item).

**Anti-Pattern**: Rendering `array.map()` on a large array. This blocks the main thread and freezes audio UI.

## 4. Image Optimization

**Rule**: Lazy load all images that are not in the viewport.
- **Component**: Use standard `img` with `loading="lazy"`.
- **Decoding**: Use `decoding="async"` to prevent image decoding from blocking the main thread.

### Embedded Artwork Resizing
**Rule**: (Planned) Never store raw 4K embedded album art in IndexedDB.
- **Action**: Resize all extracted ID3 APIC images to max ~1024px during ingestion.
- **Why**: Reduces DB size, speeds up queries, and prevents memory spikes during `createObjectURL`.
- **Status**: Currently DISABLED. `normalizeArtwork` logic in `metadata.worker.ts` is commented out due to stability issues with `OffscreenCanvas` on some files. We currently store raw blobs (with JPEG EOI repair enabled).

## 5. Re-render Hygiene

**Rule**: Audio Player components (Progress Bar, Timer) update every second.
- **Isolation**: Isolate fast-changing state into small leaf components (`ProgressBar`, `CurrentTime`).
- **Avoid**: Do not let high-frequency updates trigger a re-render of the entire `Player` or `Page`.
- **Technique**: Use Zustand atomic selectors (`usePlayerStore(s => s.progress)`).

## 6. Root Layout Hygiene

**Rule**: The Root Layout (`__root.tsx`) must NEVER subscribe to high-frequency state changes.
- **Why**: If Root re-renders, the entire React tree re-renders.
- **Fix**: Move event listeners and high-frequency logic into an isolated, memoized component (e.g., `<GlobalAudioController />`).

## 7. Event Listener Cleanup

**Rule**: All global event listeners (`window.*`, `document.*`) must be cleaned up in the `useEffect` return block.
- **Standard**: Prefer `react-hotkeys-hook` and `@use-gesture` which handle cleanup internally.

## 8. Heavy Computation (Web Workers)

**Rule**: Parsing large files (e.g., 50MB RSS XML, large SRT subtitles) must happen in a Web Worker.
- **Blocking**: Any function taking > 50ms is too slow for the main thread and will cause audio glitches.

## 9. Interaction Latency (Async Handlers)

**Rule**: Never perform an `await` in a click handler without immediate UI feedback.
- **Scenario**: Clicking a search result that needs to fetch data before playing.
- **Bad**: User clicks -> Nothing happens for 2s -> Audio plays.
- **Good**: User clicks -> **Immediate Spinner/Disable state** -> Fetch -> Audio plays.

## 10. Database Indexing (Dexie)

**Rule**: Never use `.filter()` for searching large tables.
- **Why**: This triggers a Table Scan (O(N)), reading all records into memory.
- **Fix**: Use IndexedDB indexes and `.startsWithIgnoreCase()` or `.equals()` on indexed fields.

## Planned (Pending Execution)

- **Bundle Size Budget**: Enforce gzipped size budgets in CI (Instruction 050).
- **PWA Audio Range Cache**: Offline seek with 206 support (Instruction 060).
- **Memory Stress Test**: Long-session profiling and heap checks (Instruction 061).
- **Async Race Audit**: Last-action-wins enforcement (Instruction 068).
- **Media Cache Eviction**: LRU trim policy for audio blobs (Instruction 072).
- **Event Listener Leak Audit**: Standardize global listener cleanup (Instruction 080).
